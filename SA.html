<h3> ABOUT </h3>
<p> I am the only one daughter to my parents. I have two brothers.
I am 20 years old and studying at Metropolitan University. I am a self-driven and a self-motivated student.
I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen, I like to laugh. </p>
